## What's the point?

To fight the current oligopoly situation in the gaming markets, 
the target for the Valkyrie initiative is to enable smooth integrations of numerous gaming operators to numerous game providers directly 
and thus bypass existing large platform players and aggregators.

### Traditional setup
Operators integrate directly to the providers whose content they want to offer to players.

Numerous providers require many bespoke integrations for the operator. 

### Aggregators
Commercial aggregators offer integrations to make life easier for the operators.

These integrations come with a considerable cost.

### Valkyrie
To fuel incentives to integrate directly, and thus avoiding unnecessary cost, the Valkyrie integration software is available free of charge. 
Valkyrie offers one standardized (to as great degree as possible) interface to operators and one proprietary interface per provider. 
Core functionality is implemented in a central Valkyrie component.

In addition, all Valkyrie software is open sourced to enable operators or other gaming market players to independently operate 
and maintain the software.
