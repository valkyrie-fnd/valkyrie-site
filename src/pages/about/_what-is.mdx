## What is Valkyrie?

An open source game aggregator written in Go.

Valkyrie software presents an easy way to integrate game providers to gaming operators in order to remove the need for additional
licensed aggregator software and potentially standardizing the integration. 
Valkyrie provides a generic interface for operator integration 
and game provider specific modules which can be enabled on a per provider basis.

In its current shape, Valkyrie is a thread safe, stateless, high performant adapter plug connecting providers and operators.

The software consists of a set of core functions together with a standardized operator interface client and provider specific modules. 
Valkyrie runs as a service with endpoints for provider wallet transactions,
a client communicating with operators' wallet and endpoints for server-to-server game launches for those operators/providers who prefer 
this game launch flavour. In addition, Valkyrie offers some utilities for front end game client interaction.

Optional integrations to proprietary operators' protocols can be handled on a case to case basis.

Valkyrie is configurable with respect to providers, operators, logging, tracing and communication timeouts.

The software is available as a Go binary file, packaged in container or as raw code for anyone to compile and use. 
Valkyrie is recommended to execute within operators' networks but it can optionally be deployed virtually anywhere.
