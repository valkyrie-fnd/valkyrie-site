## What's the point?

To fight the current oligopoly situation in the gaming markets, 
the target for the Valkyrie initiative is to enable smooth integrations of numerous gaming operators to numerous game providers directly 
and thus bypass existing large platform players and aggregators.
One standardized (to as great degree as possible) interface to operators and one proprietary interface per provider. 
Core functionality is implemented in a central Valkyrie component.

To fuel incentives to integrate directly, the integration software will be offered free of charge. 
In addition, all Valkyrie software will be open sourced to enable operators or other gaming market players to independently operate 
and maintain the software.
