A couple of minutes ago it was finally released on GitHub and Docker Hub.
<!--truncate-->

The Valkyrie integration component is alive and free to use. You'll find it [here](https://github.com/valkyrie-fnd/valkyrie).

The component is written in Go and constitutes, together with the mock casino operator *valkyrie-stubs*, a kick start kit to enable quick integrations between game providers and gaming operators.

Feel free to clone and start exploring the stuff! If you are not comfortable with messing around with Go source code, binaries are available in the repo.

Do you prefer to launch a readily built container image, it's available at [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/u/valkyriefnd) together with Helm stuff to ease up Kubernetes adventures.

Have fun!
