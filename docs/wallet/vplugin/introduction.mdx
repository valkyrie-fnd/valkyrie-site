Vplugin is a PAM option where you build the PAM-integration separatly and make use of [hashicorp go-plugin](https://github.com/hashicorp/go-plugin).
Please read through their documentation as well if working with vplugin.

This is the recommended approach for integrations where open sourcing a PAM integration is not an alternative.

You set the following config to use a pam as vplugin:
```yaml
pam:
  name: vplugin # Name should be set to "vplugin"
  plugin_path: path/to/plugin-executable # path to the plugin
  type: pluginName # name of the plugin, the key in the plugin map.
  # Any other configuration set here will be forwarded to the pam plugin in a map[string]any
  plugin_setting: "configValue"
```
