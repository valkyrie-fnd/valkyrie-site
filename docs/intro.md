## Valkyrie Game Aggregator
Valkyrie software is distributed freely on [GitHub](https://github.com/valkyrie-fnd/valkyrie). 

The software can be downloaded as either a Go binary, container image or you can clone the repo and build yourself.

Operational and configuration instructions - plus other things to think of - are found in the subsections of this page.
